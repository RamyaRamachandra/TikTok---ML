#### The Nuts and bolts of machine learning

Recall that you are a data professional at TikTok. Your supervisor was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

#### Course 6 End-of-course project: Classifying videos using machine learning
In this activity, you will practice using machine learning techniques to predict on a binary outcome variable.


**The purpose** of this model is to increase response time and system efficiency by automating the initial stages of the claims process.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".


This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: Ethical considerations

* Consider the ethical implications of the request

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2**: Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling
**Part 3**: Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
